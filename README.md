### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* means producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help improve other people's projects by offering your changes back to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding on GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects"](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
